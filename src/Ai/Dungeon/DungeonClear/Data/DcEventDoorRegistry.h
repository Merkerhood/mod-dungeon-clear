// Per-ENTRY list of door gameobjects that are SCRIPT-ONLY: the live client
// refuses a direct player open and ONLY an in-game event opens them, even though
// their template (an empty lock-85, the same template as plenty of plainly
// clickable doors) reads as openable to BotCanOpenDoorLikePlayer / DcDoorPolicy.
// A bot generic-Use()ing one of these toggles the server GO state while the
// client still treats the door as shut — a desync — and it also skips the
// intended event (e.g. Shadowfang Keep's courtyard door, which only opens when a
// freed prisoner walks over and unlocks it).
//
// This is DELIBERATELY keyed by GO ENTRY, not by lock id: lock 85 is shared with
// many doors bots SHOULD open (Deadmines Factory/Foundry/Mast Room, etc.), so a
// lock-level rule would break them. Keep this list to doors verified to be
// script/event-opened only; the door-blocked action consults it before deciding
// it is "entitled" to open a door, and leaves a listed door for the events
// framework or the human instead.
